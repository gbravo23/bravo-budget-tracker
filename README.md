# Bravo-Budget-Tracker

## Challenge
The challenge this week is to add functionality to an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should update the total when brought back online. The application is deployed to Heroku.
